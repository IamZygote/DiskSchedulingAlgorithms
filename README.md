# Disk Scheduling Algorithms
A windows application made using C# forms to calculate disk scheduling using many algorithms and compare between them
There also a visualization, so you see the sequence visually as figure below.

This Program Form made using **Visual Studio C#**

## Algorithms

- FCFS (First Come First Serve)
- SSTF (Shortest Seek Time First)
- LOOK
- CLOOK
- SCAN
- CSCAN
